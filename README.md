 clothing.Fashion plays a crucial role in personal identity, social
 interaction, and the economy, influencing the design of clothing,
 the fashion industry, and the way people perceive themselves and
 others.In this paper, we have used a new model of convolutional
 neural network(Alexnet) for classification and encompassing the
 identification of clothing items. Within the fashion classifica
tion category,This research helps in classifying fashion images
 by using Convolutional Neural Network’s(CNN) with Alextnet
 model.Our model is trained with extensive collection of gray scale
 images.We can input the Alextnet features and we can classify
 them according to their features.with this we got an accuracy of
 90.34% .
